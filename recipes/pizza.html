        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Buffalo Chicken Pizza is a favorite of mine, and a great meal to eat whenever you have the time 
            during the week. This recipe has the best balance of buffalo sauce, cool and blue cheese, and even a few 
        add-ons like red onions, banana peppers and green onions.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Green Onions</li>
        <li>Banana Peppers</li>
        <li>Mozzarella</li>
        <li>Buffalo Sauce</li>
        <li>Blue Cheese</li>
        <li>Red Onions</li>
        <li>Pizza Dough</li>
        <li>Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Parsley</li>
        <li>Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>Parmesan</li>
        <li>Shredded Chicken</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to<strong> 450Â° F. Note:</strong> If you have a pizza stone, put it in the oven while it preheats for more even cooking and a browner, crisper crust.</li>
        <li> <strong>Combine the shredded chicken, buffalo sauce, and 1 tablespoon of blue cheese.</strong> Let the chicken marinate while you prepare the remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Spread the dough</strong> onto a lightly greased, 12-inch pizza pan (or stone). <strong>holes in it with a fork</strong>  to prevent the crust from bubbling up in the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Top with pizza sauce,</strong> then with <strong>most of the mozzarella. Add the chicken, onions, and banana peppers, then the remaining mozzarella.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Drizzle with 3 tablespoons of blue cheese,</strong> along with <strong>1-2 tablespoons of buffalo sauce.</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Bake for 13 minutes</strong> and remove from the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the melted butter, Parmesan cheese, and garlic powder.</strong> Brush it over the crust of the pizza and return it to the oven.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake for 2-3 more minutes,</strong> or until the crust begins to brown.</li>
        <li><strong>Garnish with green onions, red pepper flakes, and parsley.</strong> Slice and serve!</li>
